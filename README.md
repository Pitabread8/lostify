# lostify

Discover "forgotten" songs from the depths of Spotify's library! Inspired by [forgotify.com](https://forgotify.com). Made with Next.js, Auth.js, and Spotify Web API.

## Features
- Find new, little-known songs
- Integrate with your personal Spotify account
- Diversify your music taste

## Reflection
I started this project because I loved the concept of Forgotify, but wanted a cleaner UI and the ability to add songs I liked to a specific playlist. It took a long time to figure out the right method for accessing the Spotify Web API using Next.js, but I'm now much more confident with data fetching. I've also learned the different between client and server components, as well as how to make custom React hooks!

## Editing

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
